Very mild forms (spinal bifida occulta), in which there are no symptoms, may never be detected. Postnatal Diagnosis  Mild cases of spina bifida (occulta, closed) not diagnosed during prenatal testing may be detected postnatally by plain film X-ray examination.  Individuals with the more severe forms of spina bifida often have muscle weakness in their feet, hips, and legs that result in deformities that may be present at birth.  Doctors may use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or a computed tomography (CT) scan to get a clearer view of the spinal cord and vertebrae.  If hydrocephalus is suspected, the doctor may request a CT scan and/or X-ray of the skull to look for extra cerebrospinal fluid inside the brain."

i want more information on hypertension and fibromyalgia i seem to be getting only topics on diabetes and i do not have this i enjoy reading the current info thanks cassie caldera,Hypertension,Information,"Ordinarily, in healthy, pain-free people, the higher their blood pressure, the less sensitive they are to pain. For some, this can present a problem because they do not sense the chest pain that could be the early warning sign of an impending heart attack. When chronic pain enters the picture, the systems that control pain and blood pressure work so poorly that an increase in blood pressure no longer leads to a reduction in pain sensitivity. The end result is that chronic pain places you at a higher risk for elevated blood pressure (hypertension)."
hello i would like more info about familial mediterean fever please as my husband suffers from this thanks,familial mediterranean fever,Information,"What is familial Mediterranean fever?  Familial Mediterranean fever is an inherited condition characterized by recurrent episodes of painful inflammation in the abdomen, chest, or joints. These episodes are often accompanied by fever and sometimes a rash or headache. Occasionally inflammation may occur in other parts of the body, such as the heart; the membrane surrounding the brain and spinal cord; and in males, the testicles. In about half of affected individuals, attacks are preceded by mild signs and symptoms known as a prodrome. Prodromal symptoms include mildly uncomfortable sensations in the area that will later become inflamed, or more general feelings of discomfort.  The first episode of illness in familial Mediterranean fever usually occurs in childhood or the teenage years, but in some cases, the initial attack occurs much later in life. Typically, episodes last 12 to 72 hours and can vary in severity. The length of time between attacks is also variable and can range from days to years. During these periods, affected individuals usually have no signs or symptoms related to the condition. However, without treatment to help prevent attacks and complications, a buildup of protein deposits (amyloidosis) in the body's organs and tissues may occur, especially in the kidneys, which can lead to kidney failure."

i have lymphoma what causes cramp after chemo treatment,cramp/chemo treatment,Complication,"Side effects of chemotherapy — Most patients who are treated with R-CHOP develop side effects, with the most common including:  ●Fever and low blood count — A potentially life-threatening side effect of chemotherapy is fever and lowered levels of a type of white blood cell, called neutrophils (the condition is called febrile neutropenia).  Anyone who is getting chemotherapy and who develops a temperature higher than 100.4°F (38°C) should immediately call his or her healthcare provider. This condition is a medical emergency and requires prompt treatment, usually with admission to a hospital and antibiotics by vein (IV).   ●Nausea and vomiting — Between 30 and 90 percent of patients develop nausea and vomiting after R-CHOP. Several medications may be given before and after chemotherapy to reduce its severity. This often includes dexamethasone and aprepitant (Emend), and a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (eg, ondansetron/Zofran, granisetron/Kytril, dolasetron/Anzemet, palonosetron/Aloxi, or tropisetron/Navoban).   ●Hypersensitivity reaction — Hypersensitivity reactions may occur the first time a chemotherapy or immunotherapy drug is given, causing flushing; itching; chest, back, or abdominal pain; fever; nausea; dizziness; and other symptoms. It is not clear why this type of reaction occurs. Several medications are usually given before chemotherapy to reduce the severity of these symptoms, including acetaminophen (Tylenol), diphenhydramine (Benadryl), hydrocortisone (a steroid), and a stomach-acid-reducing medication, such as ranitidine (Zantac).   ●Tumor lysis syndrome — Tumor lysis syndrome is a serious, potentially life-threatening condition that can occur after beginning treatment with chemotherapy. It happens because the tumor cells die quickly and release toxic break-down products into the bloodstream. Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, lack of appetite, lethargy, blood in the urine, heart problems, seizures, muscle cramps, and others. Preventive treatments are usually given before chemotherapy to reduce the risk of developing tumor lysis syndrome, including IV fluids and medications. In addition, blood tests are often done during and after treatment to monitor for the condition.   ●Other potential complications — Other potential complications of chemotherapy include damage to the heart (called cardiotoxicity) or the nerves (called neurotoxicity), or loss of the ability to have children (infertility). These risks, as well as ways to manage or monitor for them, should be discussed with a healthcare provider before beginning treatment."

what is the best thing to do for my dad who we are sure psp who are the best doctors to treat this disease we believe my uncle had psp also recently passed away i want to give my dad the best treatment available,Progressive Supernuclear Palsy,Treatment,"Is there any treatment?  There is currently no effective treatment for PSP, although scientists are searching for better ways to manage the disease. In some patients the slowness, stiffness, and balance problems of PSP may respond to antiparkinsonian agents such as levodopa, or levodopa combined with anticholinergic agents, but the effect is usually temporary. The speech, vision, and swallowing difficulties usually do not respond to any drug treatment.. Another group of drugs that has been of some modest success in PSP are antidepressant medications. The most commonly used of these drugs are Prozac, Elavil, and Tofranil. The anti-PSP benefit of these drugs seems not to be related to their ability to relieve depression. Non-drug treatment for PSP can take many forms. Patients frequently use weighted walking aids because of their tendency to fall backward. Bifocals or special glasses called prisms are sometimes prescribed for PSP patients to remedy the difficulty of looking down. Formal physical therapy is of no proven benefit in PSP, but certain exercises can be done to keep the joints limber. A surgical procedure, a gastrostomy, may be necessary when there are swallowing disturbances. This surgery involves the placement of a tube through the skin of the abdomen into the stomach (intestine) for feeding purposes.  CUREPSP (Foundation for PSP|CBD and Related Brain Diseases) 30 E.

i have an aneurysm 26cmfor the last 5yrslast checked about year agoexperiencing paintighting in abdomen and chestshould i be going to er,abdominal aortic aneurysm,Treatment,"Once an aneurysm reaches 5 centimeters in diameter, it is usually considered necessary to treat to prevent rupture. Below 5 centimeters, the risk of the aneurysm rupturing is lower than the risk of conventional surgery in patients with normal surgical risks. The goal of therapy for aneurysms is to prevent them from rupturing. Once an abdominal aortic aneurysm has ruptured, the chances of survival are low, with 80 to 90 percent of all ruptured aneurysms resulting in death. These deaths can be avoided if an aneurysm is detected and treated before it ruptures. AAA Treatments  Currently, there are three treatment options for AAA:   Watchful Waiting - Small AAAs (less than 5 centimeters or about 2 inches), which are not rapidly growing or causing symptoms, have a low incidence of rupture and often require no treatment other than watchful waiting under the guidance of a vascular disease specialist. This typically includes follow-up ultrasound exams at regular intervals to determine if the aneurysm has grown.  Surgical Repair - The most common treatment for a large, unruptured aneurysm is open surgical repair by a vascular surgeon. This procedure involves an incision from just below the breastbone to the top of the pubic bone. The surgeon then clamps off the aorta, cuts open the aneurysm and sews in a graft to act as a bridge for the blood flow. The blood flow then goes through the plastic graft and no longer allows the direct pulsation pressure of the blood to further expand the weak aorta wall.  Interventional Repair - This minimally invasive technique is performed by an interventional radiologist using imaging to guide the catheter and graft inside the patient's artery. For the procedure, an incision is made in the skin at the groin through which a catheter is passed into the femoral artery and directed to the aortic aneurysm. Through the catheter, the physician passes a stent graft that is compressed into a small diameter within the catheter. The stent graft is advanced to the aneurysm, then opened, creating new walls in the blood vessel through which blood flows."

An arm lump is a protuberance or localized area of swelling occurring on the arm. Other terms used to describe the various types of lumps include bump, nodule, contusion, tumor and cyst. Arm lumps can be caused by any number of conditions, including infections, inflammation, tumors or trauma. Depending on the cause, lumps may be single or multiple, soft or firm, painful or painless. They may grow rapidly or may not change in size.  Arm lumps due to local infectious causes may appear as boils, or abscesses. Many types of infections cause the lymph nodes to enlarge and feel like lumps, most commonly in the armpits. Traumatic causes of arm lumps range from bug bites to severe injuries that can produce a localized collection of blood in the tissues (hematoma).  Both benign and malignant tumors of the skin, soft tissues, or bones of the arm can sometimes feel like lumps. Lumps caused by infection, inflammation or trauma are usually temporary and subside as the underlying condition resolves. Lumps that persist or continue to grow over time may signal more serious conditions, such as tumors. If you have any lump that is persistent or causes you concern, seek prompt medical care."

You can take steps to lower your risk of getting yeast infections: •Do not douche. Douching removes some of the normal bacteria in the vagina that protects you from infection. •Do not use scented feminine products, including bubble bath, sprays, pads, and tampons. •Change tampons, pads, and panty liners often. •Do not wear tight underwear, pantyhose, pants, or jeans. These can increase body heat and moisture in your genital area. •Wear underwear with a cotton crotch. Cotton underwear helps keep you dry and doesn't hold in warmth and moisture. •Change out of wet swimsuits and workout clothes as soon as you can. •After using the bathroom, always wipe from front to back. •Avoid hot tubs and very hot baths. •If you have diabetes, be sure your blood sugar is under control.     Does yogurt prevent or treat yeast infections?  Maybe. Studies suggest that eating eight ounces of yogurt with ""live cultures"" daily or taking Lactobacillus acidophilus capsules can help prevent infection.5,6  But, more research still needs to be done to say for sure if yogurt with Lactobacillus or other probiotics can prevent or treat vaginal yeast infections. If you think you have a yeast infection, see your doctor or nurse to make sure before taking any over-the-counter medicine."

When a spinal deformity is discovered in an adult, it is often quite different from a deformity in an infant or juvenile. The goals for treatment are often different as is the location of the scoliosis. The deformity in an adult may have been present since childhood or may be the result of the aging process.. Besides pain in the back, patients may have pain radiating down their legs. Treatment of spine deformity in adults focuses on restoring function and alleviating pain in combination with correcting the curvature of the spine.   Causes  There are many different causes of spinal deformity in the adult. The most common varieties include idiopathic scoliosis that was present during adolescence (teenage years) and then became worse during adulthood, and deformity that began in adulthood due to degenerative (wear and tear) changes in the spine and deformity that developed later in life.

Radiation oncologists deliver external beam radiation therapy to the cancer from a machine outside your body. Doctors target the radiation beams at your tumor, giving more radiation to the skin cancer while keeping it away from underlying organs. Skin cancer is often treated with superfi cial forms of radiation. That means the radiation penetrates only a short distance below the surface. Treatment may be given with X-rays or electrons. Treatments are usually scheduled every day, Monday through Friday, for several weeks to accurately deliver radiation to the cancer. Treatments are painless and take less than half an hour each, start to fi nish. Your treatment schedule will depend on your cancer, but it usually requires daily treatments for one or more weeks. Radiation therapy can be given on its own or may also be given in addition to surgery, chemotherapy or biologic therapy. UNDERSTANDING RADIATION THERAPY Radiation therapy, also called radiotherapy, is the careful use of radiation to treat many diff erent kinds of cancer.  Cancer doctors, called radiation oncologists, use radiation therapy to try to cure cancer, to control cancer growth or to relieve symptoms such as pain.  Radiation therapy works within cancer cells by damaging their ability to multiply. When these cells die, the body naturally eliminates them.  Healthy cells that grow and divide quickly are also harmed by radiation, but they are able to repair themselves in a way that cancer cells cannot.  Most radiation is given with an external beam, but treatment can be given with a radioactive source close to the skin with a treatment called brachytherapy, meaning ‘short-distance’ treatment. POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS The side eff ects you might feel will depend on the part of your body being treated, the dose of radiation given and whether you also receive other treatments like chemotherapy. Before treatment begins, ask your doctor about possible side eff ects and how you can best manage them. Nearly all patients will experience redness and moistness of the skin, similar to a brisk sunburn. After treatment ends, the skin will form a protective scab and the new, healthy skin will develop underneath it. This healing may take several months. You will also likely lose your hair in the area treated. Your hair may grow back, but it might not have the same texture or thickness. Talk to your doctor or nurse about any discomfort you feel. He or she may be able to provide medications or other treatments to help."
my provider cant help i asked i am intolerant of all the sugar alcohols such as maltilol sorbitol xylitol etc and need something for dry mouth caused by med which i have to take biotene products help for only about two minutes,dry mouth,Treatment,"Dry Mouth Treatments  Your doctor or dentist may recommend oral rinses and moisturizers, or prescribe an artificial saliva.  Also called saliva substitutes, artificial salivas are regulated by FDA as medical devices. “Unlike drugs, artificial salivas have no chemical action,” says Susan Runner, D.D.S., chief of FDA’s dental devices branch. “Their action is mechanical. They moisten and lubricate the mouth but do not stimulate the salivary glands to make saliva.”  While not a cure, artificial salivas can provide short-term relief of the symptoms of dry mouth. “They can also help minimize discomfort after an oral procedure,” says Runner.  Artificial salivas come in a variety of forms, including rinses, sprays, swabs, gels, and tablets that dissolve in the mouth. Some are available by prescription only; others can be bought over-the-counter.  FDA has also approved several prescription drugs to relieve dry mouth caused by certain medical treatments or conditions, such as Sjögren's syndrome and radiation for head or neck cancer.  Advice for Consumers If you have persistent dry mouth: •Talk to your doctor, who may change your medications or adjust the doses. •Talk to your dentist and provide a list of the medicines you take as well as any medical conditions or treatments you’ve had. The American Dental Association recommends seeing your dentist at least twice a year.  Tips for Relieving Dry Mouth •Sip water or sugarless drinks, or suck on ice chips. •Avoid irritants, such as alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine. Remember that caffeine is found in many sodas as well as in coffee and tea. •Chew sugar-free gum or suck on sugar-free candy. •Avoid salty or spicy foods, which may irritate the mouth. •Use a humidifier in your bedroom at night. •Consider using saliva substitutes."
dear sir madam i am patient suffering from friedreichs ataxia and i heard there was medicine for it in 2009 and since we are looking for the medicine kindly help on this and i have dna report could you please help us on this as there are two people respective age 22 years and 24 years suffering from it looking for your help on this asap and please let us know when the medicine will be there in market and attaching two files for your reference,Friedreich's ataxia,Treatment,"Can Friedreich's ataxia be cured or treated?   As with many degenerative diseases of the nervous system, there is currently no cure or effective treatment for Friedreich's ataxia. However, many of the symptoms and accompanying complications can be treated to help individuals maintain optimal functioning as long as possible. Doctors can prescribe treatments for diabetes, if present; some of the heart problems can be treated with medication as well. Orthopedic problems such as foot deformities and scoliosis can be corrected with braces or surgery. Physical therapy may prolong use of the arms and legs. Advances in understanding the genetics of Friedreich's ataxia are leading to breakthroughs in treatment. Research has moved forward to the point where clinical trials of proposed treatments are presently occurring for Friedreich’s ataxia.  What research is being done?   Within the Federal government the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has primary responsibility for sponsoring research on neurological disorders. As part of this mission, the NINDS conducts research on Friedreich's ataxia and other forms of inherited ataxias at its facilities at the NIH and supports additional studies at medical centers throughout the United States. Several nonprofit organizations also provide substantial support research (see the section on ""Where can I get more information?"").   Researchers are optimistic that they have begun to understand the causes of the disease, and work has begun to develop effective treatments and prevention strategies for Friedreich's ataxia. Scientists have been able to create various models of the disease in yeast and mice which have facilitated understanding the cause of the disease and are now being used for drug discovery and the development of novel treatments.   Studies have revealed that frataxin is an important mitochondrial protein for proper function of several organs. Yet in people with the disease, the amount of frataxin in affected cells is severely reduced. It is believed that the loss of frataxin makes the nervous system, heart, and pancreas particularly susceptible to damage from free radicals (produced when the excess iron reacts with oxygen). Once certain cells in these tissues are destroyed by free radicals they cannot be replaced. Nerve and muscle cells also have metabolic needs that may make them particularly vulnerable to this damage. Free radicals have been implicated in other degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases.   Based upon this information, scientists and physicians have tried to reduce the levels of free radicals, also called oxidants, using treatment with “antioxidants.” Initial clinical studies in Europe suggested that antioxidants like coenzyme Q10, vitamin E, and idebenone may offer individuals some limited benefit. However, recent clinical trials in the United States and Europe have not revealed effectiveness of idebenone in people with Friedreich’s ataxia, but more powerful modified forms of this agent and other antioxidants are in trials at this time. There is also a clinical trial to examine the efficacy of selectively removing excess iron from the mitochondria.   Scientists also are exploring ways to increase frataxin levels through drug treatments, genetic engineering and protein delivery systems. Several compounds that are directed at increasing levels of frataxin may be brought to clinical trials in the near future. To check for current trials, visit http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Additional information is available from the groups listed in the following section.   Armed with what they currently know about frataxin and Friedreich’s ataxia, scientists are working to better define fraxatin’s role, clarify how defects in iron metabolism may be involved in the disease process, and explore new therapeutic approaches for therapy.

hello drin case of patient with kidney stone size of 12mm x 23mm what can i do pls i need your advice,Kidney Stone,Treatment,"Summary   A kidney stone is a solid piece of material that forms in the kidney from substances in the urine. It may be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a pearl. Most kidney stones pass out of the body without help from a doctor. But sometimes a stone will not go away. It may get stuck in the urinary tract, block the flow of urine and cause great pain.   The following may be signs of kidney stones that need a doctor's help: • Extreme pain in your back or side that will not go away • Blood in your urine • Fever and chills • Vomiting • Urine that smells bad or looks cloudy • A burning feeling when you urinate  Your doctor will diagnose a kidney stone with urine, blood, and imaging tests.  If you have a stone that won't pass on its own, you may need treatment. It can be done with shock waves; with a scope inserted through the tube that carries urine out of the body, called the urethra; or with surgery.

i have had renal organ transplant surgery year ago what risk factos must i avoid to prevent the recurrance of esrd and to maintain healthy functioning grafted kidney,ESRD,Treatment,"Health After Transplantation  KEEPING A HEALTHY OUTLOOK ON LIFE After an organ transplant, there is hope for the future. However, there are a number of health concerns that you will face. For example, there is the chance that your new organ will not always function as well as it should. Transplant recipients also have a higher risk of developing certain conditions such as high blood pressure, high blood lipid levels, diabetes, kidney problems, liver problems, and bone disease. Infection and cancer are also conditions you need to keep in mind.  Some conditions can affect any transplant recipient and some conditions are specific to the type of organ transplanted.    Search:         Healthy Transplant Images    CARING FOR YOUR NEW ORGAN  Lab Tests for Measuring Organ Function It is important to keep all of your scheduled checkups and lab appointments for monitoring organ function. Testing allows your transplant team to monitor the status of your transplant, detect rejection early, and start effective therapy right away OTHER HEALTH ISSUES Anti-rejection medications increase your risk of developing certain conditions such as infection and cancer. Other side effects of some anti-rejection medications include high blood pressure, diabetes, high blood lipids, kidney disease, heart attack, stroke, and bone disease. Knowing the risks and taking steps now to prevent them is a good way to keep you and your new organ healthy. KIDNEY DISEASE Kidney function is often decreased in transplant recipients. This may be caused by a pre-existing condition such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or injury to the kidney before a transplant. Or it may be caused by medications used to prevent rejection after a transplant.  The best way to help prevent kidney disease is to keep your blood pressure and blood glucose under control and to maintain a healthy weight. In addition, regular checkups with blood and urine tests will give your doctor important information for detecting early changes in kidney function and allowing appropriate steps to be taken. Self-Monitoring In addition to the tests that your transplant team will perform at regular follow-up visits, you will need to do some self-testing at home. Here are some things you will need to monitor: •Weight – Weigh yourself at the same time each day, preferably in the morning. If you gain 2 pounds in a day or more than 5 pounds total, call your transplant team. •Temperature – You should take your temperature daily, especially when you feel like you have a fever. Call your transplant team if your temperature is too high. •Blood pressure – Check your blood pressure as often as your transplant team recommends. •Pulse – You should check your pulse daily. A normal heart rate when not exercising should be 60 to 100 beats per minute. (If you have had a heart transplant, your resting heart rate may be as high as 110 to 120 beats per minute.) •Blood sugar – If you have high blood sugar or diabetes, you will need to monitor your blood sugar using a glucometer."
my question iswhat is the treatment for chronic gonorrhea massive growth,gonorrhea,Treatment,"Can gonorrhea be cured?  Yes, gonorrhea can be cured with the right treatment. It is important that you take all of the medication your doctor prescribes to cure your infection. Medication for gonorrhea should not be shared with anyone. Although medication will stop the infection, it will not undo any permanent damage caused by the disease.  It is becoming harder to treat some gonorrhea, as drug-resistant strains of gonorrhea are increasing. If your symptoms continue for more than a few days after receiving treatment, you should return to a health care provider to be checked again.  I was treated for gonorrhea. When can I have sex again?  You should wait seven days after finishing all medications before having sex. To avoid getting infected with gonorrhea again or spreading gonorrhea to your partner(s), you and your sex partner(s) should avoid having sex until you have each completed treatment. If you’ve had gonorrhea and took medicine in the past, you can still get infected again if you have unprotected sex with a person who has gonorrhea.  Photo of woman in pain.Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) What happens if I don’t get treated?  Untreated gonorrhea can cause serious and permanent health problems in both women and men. In women, untreated gonorrhea can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Some of the complications of PID are •Formation of scar tissue that blocks fallopian tubes; •Ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside the womb); •Infertility (inability to get pregnant); •Long-term pelvic/abdominal pain.  In men, gonorrhea can cause a painful condition in the tubes attached to the testicles. In rare cases, this may cause a man to be sterile, or prevent him from being able to father a child. Rarely, untreated gonorrhea can also spread to your blood or joints. This condition can be life-threatening.  Untreated gonorrhea may also increase your chances of getting or giving HIV – the virus that causes AIDS."

how can i solve this in life,Low erection and enlargement,Treatment,"Erection problems  ED drugs are not safe for everyone  Many men now take medications like Viagra, Levitra, and Cialis to treat erection problems. These medications are not safe for everyone. Before taking drugs to treat ED, talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks involved.  Never take Viagra, Levitra, or Cialis if you take heart medicines called nitrates. Doing so could cause a sudden — and dangerous — drop in blood pressure. Also, tell your doctor if you take any drugs called alpha-blockers, which are used to treat prostate enlargement or high blood pressure.  Some men have problems getting or keeping an erection. (An erection is when blood fills up the penis, making it firmer and larger.) This problem is called erectile dysfunction, or ED, and sometimes is called impotence. ED is fairly common. In fact, between 15 million and 30 million U.S. men are affected by it. ED can be very upsetting. It can affect self-esteem and cause frustration, anger, and sadness. But there are effective treatments for ED. And counseling can help you and your partner cope with any emotional effects of ED.  Causes of ED include: •Clogged blood vessels, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol •Nerve damage from diabetes •Certain medicines, including some used to treat depression or high blood pressure •Low testosterone •Unhealthy habits like smoking, drinking too much alcohol, overeating, and not exercising •Emotional factors, such as stress or depression  As men get older, ED becomes more common. By age 65, almost 25 percent of men have this problem at least one out of every four times they have sex. But ED is treatable at any age. Your doctor can offer a number of ways to treat ED. If treatment solves your ED, though, you still need to take care of any health issues that may have caused it.  Some men need to try two or three options before they find an ED treatment that works for them. Medication is one popular way to treat ED. Drugs like Viagra increase blood flow to the penis, which helps make an erection possible. Injections to the penis and medicine you put into the tip of your penis also can increase blood flow to it.  Other treatments for ED include a vacuum cylinder and pump you put on your penis to pull blood into it or inflatable rods that are put into the penis through surgery.  You may have heard of herbal products or dietary supplements that claim to treat ED or improve sexual performance. You should beware of these products even if they claim to be ""natural."" They can contain dangerous ingredients, including prescription medications that are not identified on the product's label."
i ask this as general question can pacemaker help prevent these spasms,Coronary Artery Spasms,Treatment,"Treatment   The goal of treatment is to control chest pain and prevent a heart attack. A medicine called nitroglycerin can relieve an episode of pain.  Your health care provider may prescribe other medications to prevent chest pain. You may need a type of medicine called a calcium channel blocker or a long-acting nitrate long-term. Your doctor may also prescribe a short-acting nitrate to use during an episode of chest pain.  Beta-blockers are another type of medication that may be used. However, beta-blockers may make the condition worse, and may be harmful if used with cocaine.   Outlook (Prognosis)   Coronary artery spasm is a chronic condition. However, treatment usually helps control symptoms.  The disorder may be a sign that you have a high risk for heart attack or potentially deadly irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias). The outlook is generally good if you follow your doctor's treatment recommendations and avoid certain triggers."

Peyronie’s disease is a disorder in which scar tissue, called a plaque, forms in the penis—the male organ used for urination and sex. The plaque builds up inside the tissues of a thick, elastic membrane called the tunica albuginea. The most common area for the plaque is on the top or bottom of the penis. As the plaque builds up, the penis will curve or bend, which can cause painful erections. Curves in the penis can make sexual intercourse painful, difficult, or impossible. Peyronie’s disease begins with inflammation, or swelling, which can become a hard scar.  The plaque that develops in Peyronie’s disease is not the same plaque that can develop in a person’s arteries. The plaque seen in Peyronie’s disease is benign, or noncancerous, and is not a tumor. Peyronie’s disease is not contagious or caused by any known transmittable disease."

Infertility in men can be caused by different factors and is typically evaluated by a semen analysis. A specialist will evaluate the number of sperm (concentration), motility (movement), and morphology (shape). A slightly abnormal semen analysis does not mean that a man is necessarily infertile. Instead, a semen analysis helps determine if and how male factors are contributing to infertility.   Conditions that can contribute to abnormal semen analyses include—  •Varicoceles, a condition in which the veins on a man’s testicles are large and cause them to overheat. The heat may affect the number or shape of the sperm.  •Medical conditions or exposures such as diabetes, cystic fibrosis, trauma, infection, testicular failure, or treatment with chemotherapy or radiation. •Unhealthy habits such as heavy alcohol use, testosterone supplementation, smoking, anabolic steroid use, and illicit drug use. •Environmental toxins including exposure to pesticides and lead. What causes infertility in women?  Women need functioning ovaries, fallopian tubes, and a uterus to get pregnant. Conditions affecting any one of these organs can contribute to female infertility.

A weakened heart droops and stretches and cannot contract effectively. As a result, it cannot pump enough blood to sufficiently nourish the organs. In some cases, this blood flow shortage causes severe damage to organs and tissues. Symptoms of cardiomyopathy include shortness of breath and other breathing difficulties, fatigue, swollen legs and feet, and irregular heartbeat. It can even lead to heart failure.  OTHER ALCOHOL-RELATED BRAIN CONDITIONS LIVER DAMAGE THAT AFFECTS THE BRAIN Not only does alcoholic liver disease affect liver function itself, it also damages the brain. The liver breaks down alcohol—and the toxins it releases. During this process, alcohol’s byproducts damage liver cells. These damaged liver cells no longer function as well as they should and allow too much of these toxic substances, ammonia and manganese in particular, to travel to the brain.These substances proceed to damage brain cells, causing a serious and potentially fatal brain disorder known as hepatic encephalopathy."

hi i have retinitis pigmentosa for 3years im suffering from this disease please intoduce any way to treat mg eyes such as stem cell i am 25 years old and i have only central vision please help thank you,retinitis pigmentosa,Treatment,"How is retinitis pigmentosa treated?  There is no known cure for retinitis pigmentosa. However, there are few treatment options such as light avoidance and/or the use of low-vision aids to slow down the progression of RP. Some practitioners also consider vitamin A as a possible treatment option to slow down the progression of RP. Research suggests taking high doses of vitamin A (15,000 IU/day) may slow progression a little in some people, but the results are not strong. Taking too much vitamin A can be toxic and the effects of vitamin A on the disease is relatively weak. More research must be conducted before this is a widely accepted form of therapy.  Research is also being conducted in areas such as gene therapy research, transplant research, and retinal prosthesis. Since RP is usually the result of a defective gene, gene therapy has become a widely explored area for future research. The goal of such research would be to discover ways healthy genes can be inserted into the retina. Attempts at transplanting healthy retinal cells into sick retinas are being made experimentally and have not yet been considered as clinically safe and successful. Retinal prosthesis is also an important area of exploration because the prosthesis, a man-made device intended to replace a damaged body part, can be designed to take over the function of the lost photoreceptors by electrically stimulating the remaining healthy cells of the retina.Through electrical stimulation, the activated ganglion cells can provide a visual signal to the brain. The visual scene captured by a camera is transmitted via electromagnetic radiation to a small decoder chip located on the retinal surface. Data and power are then sent to a set of electrodes connected to the decoder. Electrical current passing from individual electrodes stimulate cells in the appropriate areas of the retina corresponding to the features in the visual scene."

can lipnodes and or liver cancer be detected in upper gi,LIVER CANCER,Diagnosis,"Tests that examine the liver and the blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose adult primary liver cancer. The following tests and procedures may be used:  Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient’s health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.  Serum tumor marker test : A procedure in which a sample of blood is examined to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called tumor markers. An increased level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the blood may be a sign of liver cancer. Other cancers and certain noncancerous conditions, including cirrhosis and hepatitis, may also increase AFP levels. Sometimes the AFP level is normal even when there is liver cancer. Liver function tests : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver. A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of liver cancer. CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. Images may be taken at three different times after the dye is injected, to get the best picture of abnormal areas in the liver. This is called triple-phase CT. A spiral or helical CT scan makes a series of very detailed pictures of areas inside the body using an x-ray machine that scans the body in a spiral path. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the liver. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). To create detailed pictures of blood vessels in and near the liver, dye is injected into a vein. This procedure is called MRA (magnetic resonance angiography). Images may be taken at three different times after the dye is injected, to get the best picture of abnormal areas in the liver. This is called triple-phase MRI. Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.  Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. Procedures used to collect the sample of cells or tissues include the following: Fine-needle aspiration biopsy : The removal of cells, tissue or fluid using a thin needle. Core needle biopsy : The removal of cells or tissue using a slightly wider needle. Laparoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the abdomen to check for signs of disease. Small incisions (cuts) are made in the wall of the abdomen and a laparoscope (a thin, lighted tube) is inserted into one of the incisions. Another instrument is inserted through the same or another incision to remove the tissue samples. A biopsy is not always needed to diagnose adult primary liver cancer."

Many individuals with TS experience additional neurobehavioral problems that often cause more impairment than the tics themselves.  These include inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder—ADHD);   problems with reading, writing, and arithmetic; and obsessive-compulsive symptoms such as intrusive thoughts/worries and repetitive behaviors. For example, worries about dirt and germs may be associated with repetitive hand-washing, and concerns about bad things happening may be associated with ritualistic behaviors such as counting, repeating, or ordering and arranging.  People with TS have also reported problems with depression or anxiety disorders, as well as other difficulties with living, that may or may not be directly related to TS.  In addition, although most individuals with TS experience a significant decline in motor and vocal tics in late adolescence and early adulthood, the associated neurobehavioral conditions may persist.  Given the range of potential complications, people with TS are best served by receiving medical care that provides a comprehensive treatment plan."

can woman catch pelvic inflammatory disease from dirty toilet seat such as in campground or gas station,pelvic inflammatory disease,Cause,"The item that may be most feared: the toilet seat. Not surprising as bathrooms are hardly havens of hygiene. What many people worry about is the possibility of acquiring a sexually transmitted pathogen – “venereal disease” (VD), “sexually transmitted disease” (STD), or “sexually transmitted infection” (STI). STI has come into greater use, reflecting that many of these pathogens may be asymptomatic, or cause mild symptoms that may not be recognized as “disease” in infected individuals. While there is certainly cause for concern about rates of STIs (particularly the increasing incidence of multi-drug-resistant gonorrhoea;  also, gonorrhoea, chlamydia, and syphilis can lead to serious complications, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, resulting in chronic pain and/or infertility) toilet seats are not going to put you at risk of these infections.  Why not? Well, microbes have diverse lifestyles. The bacteria that cause chlamydia, syphilis, and gonorrhoea are transmitted primarily by sex—close contact between skin/mucous membranes. Able to attach to the epithelial cells of the urethra, cervix and other regions of the urogenital tract, these bacteria invade, sometimes spreading to other parts of the body in later stages of infection. Outside of the host, though, these cells are surprisingly fragile, susceptible to stresses of the external environment—ill-equipped to lurk and linger infectiously on the surface of the toilet seat (very different from hardier bacteria that aren’t spread sexually, like E. coli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and many others)"

Considerations  Normal skin contains cells called melanocytes. These cells produce melanin, the substance that gives skin its color.  Skin with too much melanin is called hyperpigmented skin.  Skin with too little melanin is called hypopigmented skin.  Pale skin areas are due to too little melanin or underactive melanocytes. Darker areas of skin (or an area that tans more easily) occurs when you have more melanin or overactive melanocytes.  Bronzing of the skin may sometimes be mistaken for a suntan. This skin discoloration often develops slowly, starting at the elbows, knuckles, and knees and spreading from there. Bronzing may also be seen on the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands. The bronze color can range from light to dark (in fair-skinned people) with the degree of darkness due to the underlying cause. Causes  Causes of hyperpigmentation include:      History of skin inflammation (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation)     Use of certain medications (such as minocycline)     Endocrine diseases such as Addison's disease     Hemochromatosis (iron overload)     Sun exposure  Causes of hypopigmentation include:      History of skin inflammation     Certain fungal infections (such as tinea versicolor)     Pityriasis alba     Vitiligo  Home Care  Over-the-counter and prescription creams are available for lightening the skin. If you use these creams, follow instructions carefully, and don't use one for more than 3 weeks at a time. Darker skin requires greater care when using these preparations. Cosmetics may also help cover a discoloration.  Avoid too much sun exposure. Always use sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher.  Abnormally dark skin may continue even after treatment. Experts recommend emotional support or counseling."

which drug we i take to stop water come out of my nipple,water come out of my nipple,Treatment,"Nipple discharge Email this page to a friend Print Facebook Twitter Bookmark & Share  Nipple discharge is any fluid that comes out of the nipple area in your breast. Causes  Sometimes discharge from your nipples is okay and will get better on its own. You are more likely to have nipple discharge if you have been pregnant at least once.  Nipple discharge is usually not cancer (benign), but rarely it can be a sign of breast cancer. It is important to find out what is causing it and to get treatment. Here are some reasons for nipple discharge:      Pregnancy     Recent breastfeeding     Rubbing on the area from a bra or t-shirt     Injury to the breast     Infection     Inflammation and clogging of the breast ducts     Noncancerous pituitary tumors     Small growth in the breast that is usually not cancer     Severe underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)     Fibrocystic breast (normal lumpiness in the breast)     Use of certain medicines     Use of certain herbs, such as anise and fennel     Widening of the milk ducts   Sometimes, babies can have nipple discharge. This is caused by hormones from the mother before birth. It should go away in 2 weeks.  Cancers such as Paget’s disease (a rare type of cancer involving the skin of the nipple) can also cause nipple discharge. Symptoms  Nipple discharge that is NOT normal is:      Bloody     Comes from only 1 nipple     Comes out on its own without you squeezing or touching your nipple   Nipple discharge is more likely to be normal if it:      Comes out of both nipples     Happens when you squeeze your nipples   The color of the discharge does not tell you whether it is normal. The discharge can look milky, clear, yellow, green, or brown.  Squeezing your nipple to check for discharge can make it worse. Leaving the nipple alone may make the discharge stop. Exams and Tests  Your health care provider will examine you and ask questions about your symptoms and medical history.  Tests that may be done include:      Prolactin blood test     Thyroid blood tests     Head CT scan or MRI to look for pituitary tumor     Mammography     Ultrasound of the breast     Breast biopsy     Ductography or ductogram, an x-ray with contrast dye injected into the affected milk duct     Skin biopsy, if Paget's disease is a concern   Treatment  Once the cause of your nipple discharge is found, your doctor or nurse can recommend ways to treat it. You may:      Need to change any medicine that caused the discharge     Have lumps removed     Have all or some of the breast ducts removed     Receive creams to treat skin changes around your nipple     Receive medicines to treat a health condition   If all of your tests are normal, you may not need treatment. You should have another mammogram and physical exam within 1 year."

Extended spectrum beta-lactamases are produced by most S marcescens strains.[35] International data on antimicrobial susceptibility of Serratia and other nosocomial isolates have been published.[36, 37]  Serratia infections should be treated with an aminoglycoside plus an antipseudomonal beta-lactam, as the single use of a beta-lactam can select for resistant strains. Most strains are susceptible to amikacin, but reports indicate increasing resistance to gentamicin and tobramycin. Quinolones also are highly active against most strains.  Cefepime may be a reasonable option for the treatment of infections with Serratia strains that produce AmpC β-lactamase.[38]  Definitive therapy should be based on the results of susceptibility testing because multiresistant strains are common."
hello my name is pa xiong and i am student at grant high school here in sacramento i am composing research report on sids and i was hoping you could help with some information i was particularly interested in learning weather parents should be worried about cribs death and if you could direct to some resources on that or even allow to interview you thank you for your time if you have anything else that might help i would really appreciate it you can email at paxiong25yahoocom or contact by my phone at 9162971911 thanks again,SIDS,Susceptibility,"Summary  Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden, unexplained death of an infant younger than one year old. Some people call SIDS ""crib death"" because many babies who die of SIDS are found in their cribs.  SIDS is the leading cause of death in children between one month and one year old. Most SIDS deaths occur when babies are between two months and four months old. Premature babies, boys, African Americans, and American Indian/Alaska Native infants have a higher risk of SIDS.  Although health care professionals don't know what causes SIDS, they do know ways to reduce the risk. These include      Placing babies on their backs to sleep, even for short naps. ""Tummy time"" is for when babies are awake and someone is watching     Using a firm sleep surface, such as a crib mattress covered with a fitted sheet     Keeping soft objects and loose bedding away from sleep area     Making sure babies don't get too hot. Keep the room at a comfortable temperature for an adult.     Don't smoke during pregnancy or allow anyone to smoke near your baby"
im mother of 13 year old girl that been diagnosed with endometriosis i know its not spelled right the doctor stated it was severe and uncommon for children her age she was 12 when diagnosed is there anything going on for her age she not had any treatments and hurts constantly,Endometriosis,Treatment,"What kinds of treatment are available?  Once a diagnosis of endometriosis has been made, treatment falls into the following categories.  Observation: After an evaluation and before beginning hormonal therapy, you and your gynecology (GYN) team may decide to keep track of your symptoms and try mild pain medicine. This is usually the first step for girls with premenarcheal endometriosis (who are too young to have had their first period).  Medical suppression: Hormonal treatment such as birth control pills containing estrogen and progesterone taken continuously (to stop periods) relieves symptoms in many patients. A second treatment is progesterone medicine alone. This comes as a progestin–only birth control pill in a pill pack (Nor–QD® or Camilla®) or as a regular pill that comes in a bottle Norethindrone acetate (Aygestin®).  The dose of Aygestin® can be adjusted for your body to stop your pain and bleeding. Another type of medication is a GnRH agonist, such as Leuprolide acetate (Lupron–Depot®). This medicine works by shutting off hormones made by the ovaries and temporarily stops your period. The use of GnRH agonist therapy lowers your body’s estrogen level (one of the hormones that causes your body to have periods).  Surgery: Visible endometriosis will be destroyed at the time of laparoscopy. After this procedure, many teens find relief from symptoms. Most say that their pain is better, but not completely gone. Remember, there is no cure for endometriosis. Many teens may experience pain again.  Lifestyle changes: Dealing with chronic pelvic pain can be challenging. Exercising often helps to relieve or lessen pelvic pain and menstrual cramps. Eating a balanced diet and getting enough rest also helps your body manage pain. Practicing relaxation techniques such as yoga and meditation help to ease pain too.  Pain treatment services: If you do not have relief from your symptoms, your gynecologist may refer you to a pain treatment program for an evaluation. Following an evaluation, services such as biofeedback, physical therapy, acupuncture and exercise programs may be offered.  Complementary medicine: Acupuncture, herbal remedies, homeopathy and healing touch are among popular “alternative approaches” to medical treatment. Many of these therapies can be helpful however, not every alternative approach has been scientifically proven to be safe and effective. Research studies are limited. Before experimenting with any alternative therapy, make sure that you are working with a licensed provider that has been referred to you."
physician assisted suicide legal in any state what is someone is dying and they really want to die with dignity before the disease ravages their mind,physician assisted suicide,Information,"In most states, the law prohibits assisted suicide. However, the US Supreme Court has decided that physician-assisted suicide is not necessarily unconstitutional, leaving each state to settle the issue for its residents. For example, physician-assisted suicide has been legal in Oregon since 1997, although experience has shown that it is a rarely used alternative. During the 3 years after this legalization, only 91 people opted for assisted suicide out of 90,000 who died in Oregon during that time. Washington is the only other state which has legalized physician-assisted suicide."

It happens when an injury crushes small blood vessels but does not break the skin. Those vessels break open and leak blood under the skin.  Bruises are often painful and swollen. You can get skin, muscle and bone bruises. Bone bruises are the most serious.  It can take months for a bruise to fade, but most last about two weeks. They start off a reddish color, and then turn bluish-purple and greenish-yellow before returning to normal. To reduce bruising, ice the injured area and elevate it above your heart. See your healthcare provider if you seem to bruise for no reason, or if the bruise appears to be infected."
i have exercise induced asthma would any of these non drug devises be suitable please,exercise induced asthma,Treatment,"Don't rely only on quick-relief medications  You can also use pre-exercise drugs as a quick-relief treatment for symptoms. However, you shouldn't need to use your pre-exercise inhaler more often than your doctor recommends.  Keep a record of how many puffs you use each week, how often you use your pre-exercise inhaler for prevention and how often you use it to treat symptoms. If you use it daily or you frequently use it for symptom relief, your doctor may adjust your long-term control medication.  Steps you can take to prevent or minimize symptoms of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction include the following:  Do a 10-minute warm-up that varies in intensity before you begin regular exercise. Breathe through your nose to warm and humidify the air before it enters your lungs. Wear a face mask or scarf when exercising, especially in cold, dry weather. If you have allergies, avoid triggers. For example, don't exercise outside when pollen counts are high. Avoid strenuous exercise if you have a cold or other respiratory infection. Exercise regularly to stay in shape and promote good respiratory health."

i will love to try diet i need to lose weight,weight,Treatment,"Summary Keeping a healthy weight is crucial. If you are underweight, overweight, or obese, you may have a higher risk of certain health problems.  About two thirds of adults in the U.S. are overweight or obese. Achieving a healthy weight can help you control your cholesterol, blood pressure and blood sugar. It might also help you prevent weight-related diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, arthritis and some cancers.  Eating too much or not being physically active enough will make you overweight. To maintain your weight, the calories you eat must equal the energy you burn. To lose weight, you must use more calories than you eat.

i have parasites need help,parasites,Treatment,"Treatment Options  Drug Therapies    Your doctor will choose the drug that is most effective against your intestinal parasite. You may need one dose, or you may have to take the medication for several weeks. Be careful to take the medicine exactly as it is prescribed, or it may not work.  Complementary and Alternative Therapies    Conventional medical treatments can get rid parasites more quickly and with fewer side effects than most alternative treatments. Alternative treatments may be helpful along with conventional medications. However, your doctor must find out what kind of organism is causing your problems before you start treatment. The following nutritional guidelines may help keep parasites from growing.  Nutrition and Supplements        Avoid simple carbohydrates, such as those found in refined foods, fruits, juices, dairy products, and all sugars, except honey.      Eat more raw garlic, pumpkin seeds, pomegranates, beets, and carrots, all of which have been used traditionally to kill parasites. In one study, researchers found that a mixture of honey and papaya seeds cleared stools of parasites in 23 out of 30 subjects. Drink a lot of water to help flush out your system.      Eat more fiber, which may help get rid of worms.      Probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacilus plantarum, Saccharomyces boulardii, and bifidobacteria). Help keep your digestive tract healthy. Probiotics may not be appropriate in some severely immune compromised patients. Talk to your doctor.      Digestive enzymes will help restore your intestinal tract to its normal state, which makes it inhospitable to parasites. Papain is an enzyme from the papaya plant that may help kill worms when taken 30 minutes before or after meals. Papain may increase bleeding in people with clotting disorders, or in those taking blood-thinning medications, such as warfarin (Coumadin) among others.      Vitamin C. Supports the immune system. Lower the dose if diarrhea develops.      Zinc. Supports the immune system. Zinc may interact with certain medications, particularly some antibiotics, and it may not be appropriate for people with HIV/AIDS. Talk to your doctor. "

need to fix my cross eyed,Cross Eye,Treatment,"Eye muscle repair is surgery to correct eye muscle problems that cause strabismus (crossed eyes).  Description    The goal of this surgery is to restore the eye muscles to a proper position. This will help the eyes move correctly.    Eye muscle surgery is most often done on children. However, adults who have similar eye problems may also have it done. Children will most often have general anesthesia for the procedure. They will be asleep and will not feel pain.    Depending on the problem, one or both eyes may need surgery.    After the anesthesia has taken effect, the eye surgeon makes a small surgical cut in the clear tissue covering the white of the eye. This tissue is called the conjunctiva. Then the surgeon will locate one or more of the eye muscles that needs surgery. Sometimes the surgery strengthens the muscle, and sometimes it weakens it.        To strengthen a muscle, a section of the muscle or tendon may be removed to make it shorter. This step in the surgery is called a resection.      To weaken a muscle, it is reattached to a point farther toward the back of the eye. This step is called a recession.    The surgery for adults is similar. In most cases, adults are awake, but are given medicine to numb the area and help them relax.    When the procedure is done on adults, an adjustable stitch is used on the weakened muscle so that minor changes can be made later that day or the next day. This technique often has a very good outcome."

Most people tend to focus on one activity or type of exercise.The goal, however, is to be creative and do all four types of exercise—endurance, strength, balance, and flexibility. (See ""Healthy Aging with Go4Life"")    Endurance, or aerobic, activities increase your breathing and heart rate. They help keep you healthy, improve fitness, and carry out everyday tasks.    To strengthen your muscles, you need to lift or push weight. Even very small changes can make a real difference. Stronger muscles can make it easier to get up from a chair, carry groceries, open jars, work in the garden, and even play with your grandchildren.    Each year, more than 2 million older Americans go to the emergency room because of fall-related injuries. Balance exercises are one way to help prevent falling.    Flexibility, or stretching, exercises give you more freedom of movement for everyday activities.  How can I find time to exercise?    There are a number of ways to fit exercise and physical activity into your schedule. For example, exercise first thing in the morning, or combine physical activity with a task that's already part of your day, such as walking the dog.  Do I need any equipment?    For many activities, you don't need any equipment or special clothing. All you need for brisk walking, for example, is a pair of comfortable, non-skid shoes. For strength training, you can make your own weights from unbreakable household items.  For more health and wellness information, sign up for free Healthy Aging Tips at NIH Senior Health.  Is it better to exercise in a group or alone?    The key is to do what you truly enjoy, which could be with others or on your own. A team activity like basketball or a group exercise class might be appealing. Or, on their own, some people find going to a gym regularly or working with a trainer helps them stay motivated.  What should people who are overweight or obese do?    Try walking, water exercises, dancing, or weight lifting, varying your activities to include endurance, strength, balance, and flexibility. Anything that gets you moving—even for only a few minutes a day in the beginning—is a healthy start. Feel good about what you can do, and pat yourself on the back for trying. It should get easier."

These disorders and the sleep deprivation they cause can interfere with work, driving, social activities, and overall quality of life, and can have serious health implications. Sleep disorders account for an estimated $16 billion in medical costs each year, plus indirect costs due to missed days of work, decreased productivity, and other factors.    People who have trouble sleeping often try various dietary supplements, relaxation therapies, or other complementary health approaches in an effort to fall asleep faster, stay asleep longer, and improve the overall quality of their sleep. Here are 5 things to know about what the science says about sleep disorders and complementary health approaches.        Relaxation techniques may be helpful for insomnia. Evidence indicates that using relaxation techniques before bedtime can be helpful components of a successful strategy to improve sleep habits. Other components include maintaining a consistent sleep schedule; avoiding caffeine, alcohol, heavy meals, and strenuous exercise too close to bedtime; and sleeping in a quiet, cool, dark room.              Melatonin supplements may be helpful for some people with insomnia or sleep problems caused by shift work or jet lag. Research on the use of melatonin for children is more limited; available research suggests some benefit in children, but those studies were small and only addressed short-term use of melatonin. The long-term safety of melatonin has not been investigated.              Current evidence regarding other mind and body approaches such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (a type of meditation), yoga, massage therapy, and acupuncture is either too preliminary or inconsistent to draw conclusions about whether they are helpful for sleep disorders. These mind and body practices are generally considered safe for healthy people and when performed by an experienced practitioner.              Various herbs and dietary supplements sometimes used as sleep aids, including valerian, kava, chamomile, and L-tryptophan and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) have not been shown to be effective for insomnia, and important safety concerns have been raised about a few. For example, the use of L-tryptophan supplements has been linked to eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS), a complex, potentially fatal disorder with multiple symptoms including severe muscle pain. Kava supplements have been linked to a risk of severe liver damage.              If you are considering a complementary health approach for sleep problems, talk to your health care providers. Trouble sleeping can be an indication of a more serious condition, and some prescription and over-the-counter drugs can contribute to sleep problems. So, it’s important to discuss your sleep-related symptoms with your health care providers before trying any complementary health product or practice."

Prior to surgery the patient should be in an optimal state both mentally and physically, and factors that impair healing should be minimized. The patient’s ability to tolerate the surgery and participate in the postoperative rehabilitation must be assessed prior to any surgery. Some patients may not be surgical candidates due to malnutrition, immobility, poor compliance with treatment, or chronic diseases.  Operative procedures may include skin grafts or flaps (surgical reconstruction). Which option is available may be limited due to previous surgeries, a shortage of available tissue to use, and impaired blood supply. Immediately after surgery, the operated region must be totally offloaded. Once the surgical incision has healed, the patient will be allowed to gradually apply pressure to the area.  Rates of surgical complications and recurrence rates are high. Complication rates have been reported as high as 49%. Osteomyelitis is the major cause of breakdown after surgery (WOCN, 2010)."

Look for water-based or ""noncomedogenic"" formulas for cosmetics and skin creams. (Noncomedogenic products have been tested and proven not to clog pores and cause acne.)      Remove all dirt or make-up. Wash once or twice a day, including after exercising.      Avoid scrubbing or repeated skin washing.      Shampoo your hair daily, especially if it is oily.      Comb or pull your hair back to keep the hair out of your face.     What NOT to do:        Try not to squeeze, scratch, pick, or rub the pimples. This can lead to skin infections and scarring.      Avoid wearing tight headbands, baseball caps, and other hats.      Avoid touching your face with your hands or fingers.      Avoid greasy cosmetics or creams.      DO NOT leave make-up on overnight.     If these steps do not clear up the blemishes, try over-the-counter acne medicines that you apply to your skin.        These products may contain benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid.      They work by killing bacteria, drying up skin oils, or causing the top layer of your skin to peel.      They may cause redness, drying, or peeling of the skin.     A small amount of sun exposure may improve acne slightly, but tanning mostly hides the acne. Too much exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet rays is not recommended because it increases the risk for skin cancer.    MEDICINES FROM YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER    If pimples are still a problem, a provider can prescribe stronger medicines and discuss other options with you.    Antibiotics may help some people with acne:        Oral antibiotics (taken by mouth) such as tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, erythromycin, trimethoprim, and amoxicillin      Topical antibiotics (applied to the skin) such as clindamycin, erythromycin, or dapsone     Creams or gels applied to the skin may be prescribed:        Retinoic acid cream or gel (tretinoin, Retin-A)      Prescription formulas of benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid      Topical azelaic acid     For women whose acne is caused or made worse by hormones:        A pill called spironolactone may help.      Birth control pills may help in some cases, though they may make acne worse in some women.     Minor procedures or treatments may also be helpful:        A laser procedure called photodynamic therapy may be used.      Your provider may also suggest chemical skin peeling; removal of scars by dermabrasion; or removal, drainage, or injection of cysts with cortisone.     People who have cystic acne and scarring may try a medicine called isotretinoin (Accutane). You will be watched closely when taking this medicine because of its side effects.    Pregnant women should NOT take Accutane, because it causes severe birth defects.        Women taking Accutane must use 2 forms of birth control before starting the drug and enroll in the iPledge program.      Men also need to be enrolled in the iPledge program.      Your provider will follow you on this drug and you will have regular blood tests."

hi there i am losing my hair im women by the way and i am getting spots every day big lump spots and now the hairs on my face are now showing they have become coarse please could you help i dont go out anymore im so ashamed of myself,hair loss/new acne/coarse hair on face,Treatment,"Effective treatments for some types of hair loss are available. But some hair loss is permanent. With some conditions, such as patchy alopecia, hair may regrow without treatment within a year.    Treatments for hair loss include medications, surgery, laser therapy, and wigs or hairpieces. Your doctor may suggest a combination of these approaches in order to get the best results.    The goals of treatment are to promote hair growth, slow hair loss or hide hair loss.  Medication    If your hair loss is caused by an underlying disease, treatment for that disease will be necessary. This may include drugs to reduce inflammation and suppress your immune system, such as prednisone. If a certain medication is causing the hair loss, your doctor may advise you to stop using it for at least three months.    Medications are available to treat pattern baldness. Two medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat hair loss are:        Minoxidil (Rogaine). Minoxidil is an over-the-counter liquid or foam that you rub into your scalp twice a day to grow hair and to prevent further hair loss. It may be used by men and women. With this treatment, some people experience hair regrowth, a slower rate of hair loss or both. The effect peaks at 16 weeks and you need to keep applying the medication to retain benefits.        Possible side effects include scalp irritation, unwanted hair growth on the adjacent skin of the face and hands, and rapid heart rate (tachycardia).        Finasteride (Propecia). This prescription drug is available only to men. It's taken daily in pill form. Many men taking finasteride experience a slowing of hair loss, and some may show some new hair growth. You need to keep taking it to retain benefits.        Rare side effects of finasteride include diminished sex drive and sexual function and an increased risk of prostate cancer. Women who are or may be pregnant need to avoid touching crushed or broken tablets.    Surgery    In the most common type of permanent hair loss, only the top of the head is affected. Hair transplant or restoration surgery can make the most of the hair you have left.    During this procedure, your surgeon removes tiny plugs of skin, each containing a few hairs, from the back or sides of your scalp. He or she then implants the plugs into the bald sections of your scalp. You may be asked to take a hair loss medication before and after surgery to improve results.    Surgical procedures to treat baldness are expensive and can be painful. Possible risks include infection and scarring.  Wigs and hairpieces    You may want to try a wig or a hairpiece as an alternative to medical treatment or if you don't respond to treatment. It can be used to cover either permanent or temporary hair loss. Quality, natural-looking wigs and hairpieces are available.    If your hair loss is due to a medical condition, the cost of a wig may be covered by insurance. You'll need a prescription for the wig from your doctor."

i am interested in genetic factors that may affect the risk of developing skin cancer in caucasian adults,skin cancer,Susceptibility,"Cancers generally are caused by a combination of environmental and genetic factors. With skin cancer, the environment plays a greater role, but individuals can be born with a genetic disposition toward or vulnerability to getting cancer. The risk is greatest for people who have light-colored skin that freckles easily - often those who also have red or blond hair and blue or light-colored eyes - although anyone can get skin cancer.  Skin cancer is related to lifetime exposure to UV radiation, therefore most skin cancers appear after age 50. However, the sun's damaging effects begin at an early age. People who live in areas that get high levels of UV radiation from the sun are more likely to get skin cancer. For example, the highest rates of skin cancer are found in South Africa and Australia, areas that receive high amounts of UV radiation.  About 10 percent of all patients with melanoma have family members who also have had the disease. Research suggests that a mutation in the CDKN2 gene on chromosome 9 plays a role in this form of melanoma. Studies have also implicated genes on chromosomes 1 and 12 in cases of familial melanoma."

In another third of cases, it is because of the man. The rest of the time, it is because of both partners or no cause can be found.  There are treatments that are specifically for men or for women. Some involve both partners. Drugs or surgery are common treatments. Happily, many couples treated for infertility go on to have babies."

Without treatment, people with glaucoma will slowly lose their peripheral, or side vision. They seem to be looking through a tunnel. Over time, straight-ahead vision may decrease until no vision remains.  A comprehensive eye exam can tell if you have glaucoma. People at risk should get eye exams at least every two years.

Early treatment can help protect your eyes against vision loss. Treatments usually include prescription eyedrops and/or surgery."
is there any relationship between leber congenital amaurosis and autism,Leber Congenital Amaurosis/Autism,Association,"There is much evidence in the literature suggesting that children with congenital blindness can also present autistic like features. The aetiopathogenetic and clinical significance of this association is still unclear. Given the central role played by vision in development, we set out to establish the significance of autistic-like behaviours in children with early-onset severe visual impairment. Our sample comprised 24 children (13 males, 11 females; mean age 5y 2mo; range 2-11y) affected by Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA). The results of our administration of a modified Childhood Autism Rating Scale--excluding item VII (Visual Responsiveness)--showed that only four of the children gave an overall score indicating the presence of autism (moreover, of mild/moderate degree). Hardly any of the children in our LCA sample presented major dysfunctions in their relationships with other people or in their social and emotional responsiveness, thus allowing us to exclude a genuine comorbidity with a picture of autism. Indeed, the risk facing the visually impaired child seems to concern their early interactive experiences, which may be affected by their inability to connect with others, and may be prevented through the development of specific strategies of intervention."

Also called saliva substitutes, artificial salivas are regulated by FDA as medical devices. “Unlike drugs, artificial salivas have no chemical action,” says Susan Runner, D.D.S., chief of FDA’s dental devices branch. “Their action is mechanical. They moisten and lubricate the mouth but do not stimulate the salivary glands to make saliva.”  While not a cure, artificial salivas can provide short-term relief of the symptoms of dry mouth. “They can also help minimize discomfort after an oral procedure,” says Runner.  Artificial salivas come in a variety of forms, including rinses, sprays, swabs, gels, and tablets that dissolve in the mouth. Some are available by prescription only; others can be bought over-the-counter.

To the best of our knowledge this is the largest series of adult onset SSPE patients. Most of our patients were from South India; whether a similar incidence of adult onset cases of SSPE is observed elsewhere in India is not known.  Tan et al4 reported eight cases of adult onset SSPE (⩾18 years) seen between 1980 and 1987 at a university hospital in Turkey. Age at onset was between 18 and 24 years, with a 1–9 month interval between first symptoms and diagnosis. In the published literature on adult onset SSPE, the age at onset was 20–35 years with a mean delay in diagnosis of 10.6 months.5 A similar time lag of 6.3±9.6 months in diagnosis was observed in the present study. In childhood onset SSPE, boys are more frequently affected,1 while in adults the gender distribution is reported to be equal.4,5 However, in our series there was a preponderance of males (25 males, 14 females) (table 2​2)."

what happens to someone who congestive heart failure and their kidneys are in stage 4 where can i find information on this,congestive heart failure,Prognosis,"ECENT FINDINGS:  Congestive heart failure is found in about one-quarter of cases of chronic kidney disease. The most common cause of congestive heart failure is ischemic heart disease. The prevalence of congestive heart failure increases greatly as the patient's renal function deteriorates, and, at end-stage renal disease, can reach 65-70%. There is mounting evidence that chronic kidney disease itself is a major contributor to severe cardiac damage and, conversely, that congestive heart failure is a major cause of progressive chronic kidney disease. Uncontrolled congestive heart failure is often associated with a rapid fall in renal function and adequate control of congestive heart failure can prevent this. The opposite is also true: treatment of chronic kidney disease can prevent congestive heart failure. There is new evidence showing the cardioprotective effect of carvedilol in patients on dialysis, and of simvastatin and eplerenone in patients with congestive heart failure. Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs doubles the rate of hospitalization in patients with congestive heart failure. Anemia has been found in one-third to half the cases of congestive heart failure, and may be caused not only by chronic kidney disease but by the congestive heart failure itself. The anemia is associated with worsening cardiac and renal status and often with signs of malnutrition. Control of the anemia and aggressive use of the recommended medication for congestive heart failure may improve the cardiac function, patient function and exercise capacity, stabilize the renal function, reduce hospitalization and improve quality of life. Congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease and anemia therefore appear to act together in a vicious circle in which each condition causes or exacerbates the other. Both congestive heart failure and anemia are often undertreated. Cooperation between nephrologists and other physicians in the treatment of patients with anemic congestive heart failure may improve the quality of care and the subsequent prognosis for both congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease."

i have runny nose and headache and have graves what is safe cold medicine to take over the counter,cold,Treatment,"An acute symptom is one that comes on suddenly. Acute problems, such as a headache, postnasal drip, or muscular pain due to exercise, often are not serious conditions, and may be treated with a properly chosen over-the-counter medication. Remember, however, that selfmedication may be challenging if a patient is taking prescription or nonprescription medication. Drug-with-drug interactions are a major reason for complications. When taking thyroid supplements, high-blood-pressure medications, etc., it is always best to consult your doctor or pharmacist before using any other medication. What seems like a simple and safe product for a headache might cause a significant and dangerous combination with some prescription medications. If acute symptoms continue, despite supportive therapies like proper over-thecounter medication, rest (where necessary) and time, a symptom becomes chronic. Chronic problems usually indicate the need for skilled diagnosis that a physician provides. Simply put, if a problem persists, do not continue to self medicate, see your doctor."

i have undergone total hip replacement of both my hip jonts in 1977 charnley process my left joint is completely worn outhow safe and effective is revision surgerycan i get cementless jointi am 66 years oldan early repy to my query will be very much appreciated,Total Hip Replacement,Treatment,"When Is Revision Surgery Necessary?  Hip replacement is one of the most successful orthopaedic surgeries performed. However, because more people are having hip replacements at a younger age, and wearing away of the joint surface becomes a problem after 15 to 20 years, replacement of an artificial joint, which is also known as revision surgery, is becoming more common. It is more difficult than first-time hip replacement surgery, and the outcome is generally not as good, so it is important to explore all available options before having additional surgery.  Doctors consider revision surgery for two reasons: if medication and lifestyle changes do not relieve pain and disability, or if x rays of the hip show damage to the bone around the artificial hip that must be corrected before it is too late for a successful revision. This surgery is usually considered only when bone loss, wearing of the joint surfaces, or joint loosening shows up on an x ray. Other possible reasons for revision surgery include fracture, dislocation of the artificial parts, and infection."
my dad is being treated at university of washington school of medicine for infection cause by hole in his urine tract and i am interested in any treats for his problem,urine tract infection,Treatment,"Intraperitoneal Rupture: If the tear is on the top of the bladder, the hole will usually communicate with the abdominal cavity that holds all of the vital organs (liver, spleen and bowel). This injury should be surgically repaired. Urine that leaks into the abdomen is a serious problem. The repair is performed by making an abdominal incision and sewing the tear closed. A catheter is left in the bladder for up to 2 weeks to rest the bladder after the surgery, either through the urethra or coming directly out the abdominal wall, below the bellybutton.  Extraperitoneal Rupture: If the tear is at the bottom or sides of the bladder, the urine will not leak into the abdominal cavity but into the tissues around the bladder. Patients who have complex injuries of this type should have surgical repair of the injury but in some circumstances small injuries can be treated by simply placing a large diameter catheter into the bladder to keep it empty and allow the urine and blood to drain out into a collection bag. If the catheter does not drain properly, surgical repair is required. Allowing the bladder to repair itself in this fashion usually takes at least 10 days and the catheter is not removed until an X-ray is done as described above to prove the leak has sealed.  Penetrating Injuries: Patients who have injury to the bladder from a penetrating object are usually operated upon and the hole(s) is surgically repaired. Most of the time other organs in the area will be injured and need repair as well. A catheter is left in the bladder to drain the urine and blood as described above."

Russell-Silver syndrome is a growth disorder characterized by slow growth before and after birth. Babies with this condition have a low birth weight and often fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate (failure to thrive). Head growth is normal, however, so the head may appear unusually large compared to the rest of the body.

Adults with Russell-Silver syndrome are short; the average height for affected males is about 151 centimeters (4 feet, 11 inches) and the average height for affected females is about 140 centimeters (4 feet, 7 inches).  Many children with Russell-Silver syndrome have a small, triangular face with distinctive facial features including a prominent forehead, a narrow chin, a small jaw, and down-turned corners of the mouth. Other features of this disorder can include an unusual curving of the fifth finger (clinodactyly), asymmetric or uneven growth of some parts of the body, and digestive system abnormalities.

However, patients often do not get to the hospital soon enough to receive these drugs, or they cannot take these drugs because of a health condition.  People who have a stroke due to a blood clot (ischemic stroke) have a better chance of surviving than those who have a stroke due to bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke).  The risk for a second stroke is highest during the weeks or months after the first stroke. The risk begins to decrease after this period."

The treatment of chronic diarrhea is determined by its cause. Follow the advice of your health care provider.      Diarrhea caused by an infection sometimes can be treated with antibiotics or other drugs. However, the correct diagnosis must be made so that the proper medication can be prescribed.     Diarrhea not caused by an infection can be more difficult to diagnose and therefore treat. Long term medical treatment and nutritional support may be necessary. Surgery may be required to treat some causes of chronic diarrhea.  For diarrhea whose cause has not been determined, the following guidelines may help relieve symptoms. Follow the advice of your health care provider.      Remain well hydrated and avoid dehydration. Serious health problems can occur if the body does not maintain proper fluid levels. Diarrhea may become worse and hospitalization may be required if dehydration occurs.     Maintain a well-balanced diet. Doing so may help speed recovery.     Avoid beverages that contain caffeine, such as tea, coffee, and many soft drinks.     Avoid alcohol; it can lead to dehydration"

what if you do not have surgery to remove papilloma,intraductal papilloma,Prognosis,"Your specialist will be able to advise you of the most appropriate treatment or follow up (further checks) if you have an intraductal papilloma. They may feel that no further treatment is needed after either a core or vacuum assisted biopsy.  However, they may still want to do another operation (excision biopsy) to remove more breast tissue. In some centres, vacuum assisted excision biopsy may be used as an alternative to surgery. Following an injection of local anaesthetic, a small cut is made in the skin. A hollow probe connected to a vacuum device, is placed through this.  Using ultrasound or mammography as a guide, breast tissue is sucked through the probe by the vacuum into a collecting chamber. The biopsy device is used until the area being investigated has been removed. This may mean that an operation under a general anaesthetic can be avoided. The tissue removed is sent to the laboratory and examined under a microscope.  If your nipple continues to produce discharge after surgery, or if there’s inflammation around it, you may need to have a further operation to remove the affected duct or ducts. You may be offered a microdochectomy (removal of the affected duct or ducts) or a Hadfield’s operation (removal of all the major ducts). The operation should solve the problem, but if the discharge comes back more ducts may need to be removed, as finding all the ducts can sometimes be difficult.  The operation is usually done under a general anaesthetic, and you’ll be in hospital for the day or overnight. You’ll have a small wound near the nipple with a stitch or stitches in it, and your doctors will tell you how to look after this and give you advice about pain relief. The operation will leave a small scar but this will fade in time. After the operation your nipple may be less sensitive than before.  After the intraductal papilloma has been removed, follow up is not usually required. However, for some people, a short-term follow up with the specialist may be needed if only a core biopsy/vacuum assisted biopsy has been performed. People with multiple intraductal papillomas and those whose intraductal papillomas contained atypical cells are likely to have follow-up appointments with their specialist for longer."

i have numbnesstingling in my lower right arm from elbow to my fingers emg shown nothing abnormal i have had this for long time i need help,numbness/tingling,Treatment,"Home Care  Your doctor should find and treat the cause of your numbness or tingling. Treating the condition may make the symptoms go away or stop them from getting worse. For example, if you have carpal tunnel syndrome or low back pain, your doctor may recommend certain exercises.  If you have diabetes, your doctor will discuss ways to control your blood sugar levels.  Low levels of vitamins will be treated with vitamin supplements.  Medications that cause numbness or tingling may need to be switched or changed. Do not change or stop taking any of your medicines or take large doses of any vitamins or supplements until you have talked with your doctor.  Because numbness can cause a decrease in feeling, you may be more likely to accidentally injure a numb hand or foot. Take care to protect the area from cuts, bumps, bruises, burns, or other injuries."
we need treatment for balance disorder my father losses his balance while walking or climbing steps so please so please help us in curing the disorder,balance disorder,Treatment,"How are balance disorders treated?  The first thing a doctor will do if you have a balance problem is determine if another health condition or a medication is to blame. If so, your doctor will treat the condition, suggest a different medication, or refer you to a specialist if the condition is outside his or her expertise.  If you have BPPV, your doctor might recommend a series of simple movements, such as the Epley maneuver, which can help dislodge the otoconia from the semicircular canal. In many cases, one session works; other people need the procedure several times to relieve their dizziness. Figure 1: The ear and the vestibular system Dislodging otoconia using the Epley maneuver Credit: NIDCD  If you are diagnosed with Ménière's disease, your doctor may recommend that you make some changes to your diet and, if you are a smoker, that you stop smoking. Anti-vertigo or anti-nausea medications may relieve your symptoms, but they can also make you drowsy. Other medications, such as gentamicin (an antibiotic) or corticosteroids may be used. Although gentamicin may reduce dizziness better than corticosteroids, it occasionally causes permanent hearing loss. In some severe cases of Ménière's disease, surgery on the vestibular organs may be needed.  Some people with a balance disorder may not be able to fully relieve their dizziness and will need to find ways to cope with it. A vestibular rehabilitation therapist can help you develop an individualized treatment plan.  Talk to your doctor about whether it’s safe to drive, as well as ways to lower your risk of falling and getting hurt during daily activities, such as when you walk up or down stairs, use the bathroom, or exercise. To reduce your risk of injury from dizziness, avoid walking in the dark. You should also wear low-heeled shoes or walking shoes outdoors. If necessary, use a cane or walker and modify conditions at your home and workplace, such as by adding handrails."
